## Overview of the School District Analysis
###Purpose of the analysis

The chief data scientist for a local school district, Maria, has asked for a report that analyzes the performances of the local schools both district and charters. 
Collecting data from students performances on tests from all grades will show how productive the schools are and whether the budgets afforded them are paying off.  
Using Jupyter notebooks and the open source Python library, Pandas, we are able to group the data into various charts for comparison.
