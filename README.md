## Overview of the School District Analysis
urpose of the analysis

The chief data scientist for a local school district, Maria, has asked for a report that analyzes the performances of the local schools both district and charters. 
Collecting data from students performances on tests from all grades will show how productive the schools are and whether the budgets afforded them are paying off.  
Using Jupyter notebooks and the open source Python library, Pandas, we are able to group the data into various charts for comparison.

#Analysis Results:

By removing the 9th grade class of Thomas High School (charter) we can see some interesting changes to the summary chart.

![Per_school_summary_nan](https://github.com/GrahamNeal13/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Per_school_summary_nan.png)

As we can see by comparing the two charts there is a significant change in the performance of Thomas High School.  The following list are some of the observable results.  

  1. The performance of the school increases when the 9th grade is removed.
  2. Thomas High School rises to the top 5 performing schools.
  3. The student count drops from 1635 to 1174
  4. The overall passing percentage increases from 65.076 to 90.630.

Based on these changes we can see that there is an issue within the freshman class of the Thomas High School that is lowering there performance and will require closer examination.  It may be the test results or even the staff and students that are the reason for the poor performance.  
Using this summary the District commision will be able to take steps to correct these issues and help to imporve this charter school.  
Another observation can be made that the district schools all perform reasonably well and should be considered for increaseing the budgets as the students from these schools all perform well and as cost per student shows they may benefit from an increase in the schools' budgets.
